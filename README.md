### This app was created for project #4 of the GwG Nanodegree

The purpose of this app was to explore creating custom Array Adapters, storing values and working with Intents. The biggest challenges of this was moving back and forward from Activity to Activity because we are passing information with putExtra(). This method is part of the Intent class which has two inputs, a String key, and Bundle value. 

This is not a working media player, but could be easily hooked up in the future to pull in category data, track artwork, and audio media.
